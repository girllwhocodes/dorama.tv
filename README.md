We have created a doram website where you can find new premieres. Our task was to create the most effective and convenient website for viewing doramas.

During the execution of this project, I started working with writing HTML code, as this is the basis on which we worked further. Then I made all the necessary changes using CSS. 
We have 4 main pages and 2 login and registration pages. The first page of home contains information about our website. On page 2, new premieres of doramas. On the third page there are dramas that can be viewed. And the last page contacts there addresses and communication methods.
Almost all pages use animation such as slider text, background, buttons, social network icons and some photos also have animation. All animation was done using css and html.
Since there are photos of premieres and just viewing doramas, they were made using Flexbox and Grid.
The site also has an adaptation to mobile devices. When the screen becomes narrower, a button appears on the right to select a specific tab. So that this little button that opens the menu when pressed, I wrote a small function through Jquery.

I have added JavaScript functions. I used jQuery animation, made a login/registration form, checking with regular expressions. CRUD was also used to create the admin panel.
